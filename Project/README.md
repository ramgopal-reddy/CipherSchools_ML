# Product Purchase Likelihood Predictor

## Goal

Predict whether a customer is likely to purchase a product using machine learning models. This is a **binary classification** task based on behavioral and demographic customer data.

---

## Problem Statement

In e-commerce and online marketing, predicting a customer's likelihood to purchase can significantly enhance targeting strategies and conversion rates. By analyzing user interaction data, we aim to build predictive models to identify high-intent buyers and personalize their experience.

---

## Dataset

The dataset includes information about users and their interactions with a product page.

| Feature             | Description                                        |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `TimeOnSite`        | Time spent on the website (in minutes)             |
| `Age`               | Customer's age                                     |
| `Gender`            | Customer's gender (Male/Female)                    |
| `AdsClicked`        | Number of advertisements clicked                   |
| `PreviousPurchases` | Number of previous purchases                       |
| `Purchase`          | Target variable (1 = Purchased, 0 = Not Purchased) |

## Models Used

We trained and compared the performance of two classification models:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**

---

## How to Run the Project

### Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```
````

---

### Steps to Run in Google Colab

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload the project notebook (`product_purchase_likelihood.ipynb`)
3. Upload your dataset (`dataset.csv`)
4. Run each cell in order

---

## Evaluation Metrics

Both models were evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Precision / Recall / F1-Score**

These metrics provide a complete picture of classification performance.

## Real-World Applications

- **E-Commerce Personalization**: Recommend products to users based on their likelihood to purchase
- **Ad Targeting**: Show personalized ads to high-intent users
- **Churn Prevention**: Detect disengaged or low-intent customers early
- **Sales Funnel Optimization**: Improve marketing strategies and ROI

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add feature importance analysis (e.g., SHAP values, permutation importance)
- [ ] Tune hyperparameters with GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV
- [ ] Save models using `joblib` or `pickle` for deployment
- [ ] Deploy the model with Streamlit or Flask for live predictions
- [ ] Add additional algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
